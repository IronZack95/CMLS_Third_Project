Good afternoon everybody,
we are group sixteen, today we present our drum kit project.

Our main goal was to create a comfortable and ALL-IN-ONE interactive environment to facilitate
a musician during a live performance, expanding as much as possible the possibility
of interaction between human and hardware, without having to worry about the codes.

In particular, we can divide this setup into a part of direct interaction between
the midi devices and the server, and a part of network connections,
in which we have created a framework for future expansions and greater interactions,
over the distances.

Our Drumkit is composed by 9 drums or percussive sounds that can be played with
a launchpad but also by 5 synthesisers that can be played with a MIDI keyboard.

Moreover, 4 different effects can be applied to the sounds.
The musician can also add his own voice to the composition using an input microphone.
