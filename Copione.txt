Our Drumkit is composed by 9 drums or percussive sounds that can be played with a launchpad but also by 5 synthesisers that can be played with a MIDI keyboard.

Moreover, 4 different effects can be applied to the sounds.
The musician can also add his own voice to the composition using an input microphone. 

To better manage and modify the different sections we divided the code in 5 different Supercollider scd files.

We also dedicated a specific code file to the serial, OSC and MIDI connections with the external devices.
