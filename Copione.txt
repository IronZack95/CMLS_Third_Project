Our Drumkit is composed by 9 drums or percussive sounds that can be played with a launchpad but also by 5 synthesisers that can be played with a MIDI keyboard.

Moreover, 4 different effects can be applied to the sounds.
The musician can also add his own voice to the composition using an input microphone. 

To better manage and modify the different sections we divided the code in 5 different Supercollider scd files.

We also dedicated a specific code file to the serial, OSC and MIDI connections with the external devices.

Last but not least, we wanted to create a procedural animation capable of changing and moving acording to the different sounds of the drum kit.
We used a specific programming language called Processing.
We started from a code that we found on the web that allows to make an animation on mp3 track and we implemented it in such a way that it works on the real audio buffer to make a cool animation in real time!
We used the MInim library and a particoular driver called "virtual audio-cable" to take the audio that came out from an application on the computer and reinsert it into the computer as an input to another application.
